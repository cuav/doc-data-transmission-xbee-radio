This module is easy to use and is especially suitable for unmanned unit networks and point-to-point over-the-horizon transmission, providing stable, critical data transmission between drones and equipment. Their small size saves valuable on-board space. Characteristic Ultra high receiving sensitivity Highest -110dBm Receiver Sensitivity in Low Rate Mode Long distance The low-speed mode supports up to 14km *****.

Generally, you only need to modify the VID to achieve the effect of isolation from communication with other modules. For example, if you modify other configurations, familiarize yourself with the documentation and then modify it carefully. Connect with flight controller: PixHack: Radio Interface Plugged into Flight Control Pixhawk: plug into the flight controller's telem1 or telem2 interface Ground station use: In theory, the ground stations of the PIX are compatible. Please select 57600 baud rate when connecting. Note whether the driver is installed correctly and whether the port number is selected. If using a mobile OTG connection, the distance may be short because OTG power is not enough Power requirements: The ground end must ensure that the usb port power supply current is greater than 250MA, and independent power supply is recommended if conditions permit (some old notebooks/cell phones/tablets may not move). Apply to other systems: If only the wireless data transmission module is used, please follow the interface definition and the system connection (RX-TX TX-RX GND-GND) The default standard interface rate is 57600. The required interface baud rate can be changed according to the requirements.
