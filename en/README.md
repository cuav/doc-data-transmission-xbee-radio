## CUAV XBEE  Over the horizon data transmission module

## Summarize {#概述}

---

CUAV XBEE Radio is a high-power, high-speed, high-reception sensitivity data transmission module

It has a built-in S3B RF module from the United States DIGI company, transmitting power up to 250mW, ISM 900MHZ legal frequency, supporting a variety of advanced network options and topology modes

The CUAV XBEE Radio module offers an unprecedented range of low-cost wireless data solutions. This module is easy to use and is especially suitable for unmanned unit networks and point-to-point over-the-horizon transmission, providing stable, critical data transmission between drones and equipment. Their small size saves valuable on-board space.
